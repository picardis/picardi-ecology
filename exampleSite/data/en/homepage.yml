  description: I am a Movement Ecologist based in the U.S. My work focuses on quantifying
    animal movement patterns to reveal underlying behaviors, examine how those translate
    into fitness, and inform wildlife conservation and management.
  content: My recent work has focused on endangered and threatened bird species across
    North America. I use new technologies, cutting-edge analytical tools, and big
    data approaches to improve our understanding of movement as a behavioral adaptation
    to dynamic environments.

  title: RESEARCH
  content: "\nIn todayâ€™s rapidly changing world, wildlife are facing anthropogenic
    pressures increasing at a fast pace. As a movement ecologist, I study animal movement
    to understand how individuals and populations ecologically adjust and evolutionarily
    adapt to a changing environment. \n\nMy research integrates empirical approaches,
    theoretical advancements, and analytical innovations to uncover behavioral processes
    underlying movement patterns across spatio-temporal scales. This information can
    help us better conserve imperiled species. "
